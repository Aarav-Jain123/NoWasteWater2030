PHOTOGRAPH FROM THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC IMAGE COLLECTION BACKGROUND INFO VOCABULARY Climate change is already affecting water access for people around the world, causing more severe droughts and floods. Increasing global temperatures are one of the main contributors to this problem. Climate change impacts the water cycle by influencing when, where, and how much precipitation falls. It also leads to more severe weather events over time. Increasing global temperatures cause water to evaporate in larger amounts, which will lead to higher levels of atmospheric water vapor and more frequent, heavy, and intense rains in the coming years. Climate scientists predict that this shift will lead to more floods since more water will fall than vegetation and soil can absorb. The remaining water, or runoff, drains into nearby waterways, picking up contaminants like fertilizer on the way. Excess runoff eventually travels to larger bodies of water like lakes, estuaries, and the ocean, polluting the water supply and limiting water access for humans and ecosystems. When fertilizers from farming wash into lakes and the ocean, they promote the rapid growth of algae. These resulting algal blooms clog coasts and waterways with clouds of green, blue-green, red, or brown algae. The blooms block sunlight from reaching underwater life and diminish oxygen levels within the water. Toxins from the blooms can kill off fish and other aquatic animals, make people sick, and even kill humans. These toxins are especially dangerous because they can survive purification processes, making tap water unfit to consume once contaminated. Algal blooms also impact industries that rely on the water for business, and often cause local waterfronts to shut down during blooms. As the climate warms, harmful algal blooms happen more often and become more severe. As the ocean warms, freshwater glaciers around Earth begin to melt at an unsustainable rate, which results in rising sea levels. The freshwater from the melted glaciers eventually runs into the ocean. With the rising of sea levels, salt water can more easily contaminate underground freshwater-bearing rocks, called aquifers. A process called desalination removes salt from salt water, but it is a last-resort, energy-intensive, costly process for places where there are persistent droughts and freshwater is lacking. The Middle East, North Africa, and the Caribbean use desalination to produce freshwater out of necessity. In the Northern Hemisphere—where snow, a freshwater source, typically accumulates—warmer temperatures mean less snowfall, which leaves less water available in local reservoirs after winter. This negatively impacts farmers, who are left without enough water to irrigate their crops in the growing season. There are many things that everyone can do to lessen the impact of climate change. Some measures include growing your own fruits and vegetables or buying locally grown produce, since produce is often transported to grocery stores from far away by trucks, which add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. You could also walk or ride a bike instead of driving a car. On a larger scale, industries that are dependent on fossil fuels need to make the switch to renewable, cleaner energy sources to influence our planet for the better.

There are two types of water scarcity. One is physical. The other is economic water scarcity.[2]: 560 Physical water scarcity is where there is not enough water to meet all demands. This includes water needed for ecosystems to function. Regions with a desert climate often face physical water scarcity.[3] Central Asia, West Asia, and North Africa are examples of arid areas. Economic water scarcity results from a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers, aquifers, or other water sources. It also results from weak human capacity to meet water demand.[2]: 560 Many people in Sub-Saharan Africa are living with economic water scarcity.[4]: 11 Map of global water stress (a symptom of water scarcity) in 2019. Water stress is the There is enough freshwater available globally and averaged over the year to meet demand. As such, water scarcity is caused by a ratio of water use relative to water availability mismatch between when and where people need water, and when and where it is available.[5] This can happen due to an increase in the and is therefore a demand-driven scarcity.[1] number of people in a region, changing living conditions and diets, and expansion of irrigated agriculture.[6][7][8] Climate change (including droughts or floods), deforestation, water pollution and wasteful use of water can also mean there is not enough water.[9] These variations in scarcity may also be a function of prevailing economic policy and planning approaches. Water scarcity assessments look at many types of information. They include green water (soil moisture), water quality, environmental flow requirements, and virtual water trade.[8] Water stress is one parameter to measure water scarcity. It is useful in the context of Sustainable Development Goal 6.[10] Half a billion people live in areas with severe water scarcity throughout the year,[5][8] and around four billion people face severe water scarcity at least one month per year.[5][11] Half of the world's largest cities experience water scarcity.[11] There are 2.3 billion people who reside in nations with water scarcities (meaning less than 1700 m3 of water per person per year).[12][13][14] There are different ways to reduce water scarcity. It can be done through supply and demand side management, cooperation between countries and water conservation. Expanding sources of usable water can help. Reusing wastewater and desalination are ways to do this. Others are reducing water pollution and changes to the virtual water trade. Definitions [edit] Water scarcity has been defined as the "volumetric abundance, or lack thereof, of freshwater resources" and it is thought to be "human- driven".[15]: 4 This can also be called "physical water scarcity".[4] There are two types of water scarcity. One is physical water scarcity and the other is economic water scarcity.[2]: 560 Some definitions of water scarcity look at environmental water requirements. This approach varies from one organization to another.[15]: 4 Related concepts are water stress and water risk. The CEO Water Mandate, an initiative of the UN Global Compact, proposed to harmonize these in 2014.[15]: 2 In their discussion paper they state that these three terms should not be used interchangeably.[15]: 3 Global physical and economic water scarcity Some organizations define water stress as a broader concept. It would include aspects of water availability, water quality and accessibility. Accessibility depends on existing infrastructure. It also depends on whether customers can afford to pay for the water.[15]: 4 Some experts call this economic water scarcity.[4] The FAO defines water stress as the "symptoms of water scarcity or shortage".[16] The World Bank defines water stress as "the ratio of water withdrawals to available water resources".[17] The World Bank also defines water scarcity as "the ratio of water withdrawals to available water resources".[18] The World Bank defines water scarcity as "the ratio of water withdrawals to available water resources".[18] The World Bank defines water scarcity as "the ratio of water withdrawals to available water resources".[18] The World Bank defines water scarcity
